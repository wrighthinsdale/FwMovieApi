# FwMovieApi
.Net exercise that allows movies to be searched and ranked by users.
To start this up, clone the repo, open the FwMovieApi.csproj file, and click F5 to start debugging. 
The project should open straight up into swagger as a default URL, and you should be good to start working with the finished exercise.
